.Op Fl q
.Op Fl d Ar devname
.Op Fl w Ar what
.Op Fl p Ar part
.Op Fl c Ar channels
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the given frequency response for the given
.Xr virtual_oss 8
instance via the control character device given by the -d option.
The design goal of this equalizer is to provide precise equalization
for arbitrary requested frequency response at the expense of higher
latency, utilizing a so-called finite impulse response, FIR, filter.
.Pp
The requested frequency response is configured via standard input or
the file specified by the -f option.
There is one control point in per line.
Each line consists of two numbers, frequency in Hz and requested
amplification.
Amplification between two consecutive control points is a linear
interpolation of the given control point values.
.Pp
To make the filter finite, it is windowed in time domain using a Hann
window.
The windowing actually modifies the frequency response - the actual
response is a convolution of the requested response and spectrum of
the window.
This is, however, very close to the requested response.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
Be quiet and don't print anything to standard output.
.It Fl d Ar device
The
.Xr virtual_oss 8
control character device.
.It Fl w Ar what
Select what part the FIR filter should apply to.
Valid values are: rx_dev, tx_dev, rx_loop and tx_loop.
The default value is tx_dev.
.It Fl p Ar part
Select the index of the part given by the -w option to apply the filter to.
Default is zero.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Select number of channels to apply filter to, starting at channel zero.
By default all channels of the given part are updated.
.It Fl f Ar file
Read filter coefficients from the given file instead of standard input.
.It Fl o
Turn equalizer off.
.It Fl h
Show usage.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To pass only frequencies between 200Hz and 400Hz:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Note that the -F and -G options enable FIR filtering.
virtual_oss -B -C 2 -c 2 -S -Q 0 -b 32 -r 48000 -s 8ms -F 80ms -G 80ms \\
    -f /dev/dsp -d dsp.virtual -t vdsp.ctl

# For simplex operation use this:
virtual_oss -B -C 2 -c 2 -S -Q 0 -b 32 -r 48000 -s 8ms -F 80ms -G 80ms \\
    -R /dev/null -O /dev/dsp -d dsp.virtual -t vdsp.ctl

# Load normalized filter points to avoid sample value overflow
