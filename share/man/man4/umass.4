.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm umass
.Nd USB Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device da"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device pass"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device umass"
.Pp
In
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Cd umass_load
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mass Storage devices that attach to the USB
interface.
.Pp
If the appropriate hardware is detected,
the driver will be loaded automatically by
.Xr devmatch 8 .
To load the driver manually at boot time, use the
.Cm umass_load
command at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt, or add it to
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Pp
To use the driver in a custom kernel,
.Xr usb 4
and at least one of
.Xr uhci 4 ,
.Xr ohci 4 ,
.Xr ehci 4 ,
or
.Xr xhci 4
must be configured in the kernel.
Additionally, since
.Nm
uses the SCSI subsystem and sometimes acts as a SCSI device, it
requires
.Xr da 4
and
.Xr scbus 4
to be included in the kernel.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports USB Mass Storage devices such as:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
USB thumb drives
.It
USB hard disk drives
.It
USB floppy drives
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Rescan all slots on a multi-slot flash reader,
where the slots map to separate LUNs on a single SCSI ID:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
camcontrol rescan 0:0:0
camcontrol rescan 0:0:1
camcontrol rescan 0:0:2
camcontrol rescan 0:0:3
.Ed
.Pp
Typically only the first slot will be enabled at boot time.
This assumes that
the flash reader is the first SCSI bus in the system and has 4 slots.
