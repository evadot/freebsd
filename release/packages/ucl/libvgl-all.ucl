comment = "Video Graphics Library"

desc = <<EOD
libvgl is a library that enables the programmer access to the graphics
modes supported by the console driver (syscons).  The library takes care
of programming the actual video hardware, and provides a number of simple
functions to do various graphic operations.

There is also support for a mouse via the standard mouse system in FreeBSD,
including the ability to transparently have a mouse pointer superimposed on
the graphic image currently being worked on.

The library takes care of screen switching by storing the current image in
memory before switching to another virtual console, and restoring when the
user switches back.  This allows several graphic applications at once, but
on different virtual consoles.
