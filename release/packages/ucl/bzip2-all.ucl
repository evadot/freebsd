comment = "A block-sorting data compressor"

desc = <<EOD
bzip2 compresses data using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression
algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally considerably better
than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and
approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.
